    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Experience the vibrant flavors of Italy with our exquisite Italian Chicken Marinade. Succulent chicken,
        tenderized and infused with a harmonious blend of traditional Italian herbs and spices, awaits you. Our
        masterful combination of fragrant basil, robust oregano, and aromatic rosemary creates a symphony of flavors
        that dance on your palate.Prepared with the finest olive oil, our marinade not only enhances the natural
        juiciness of the chicken but also adds a touch of Mediterranean authenticity. The rich notes of garlic and tangy
        accents of lemon juice or vinegar perfectly balance the herbaceous profile, resulting in a tantalizing culinary
        masterpiece.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and
            turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to
            8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165
            degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
